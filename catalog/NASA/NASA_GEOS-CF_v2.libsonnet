    The Goddard Earth Observing System Composition Forecast (GEOS-CF) system is
    a high-resolution (0.25&deg;) global constituent prediction system from
    NASA's [Global Modeling and Assimilation Office(GMAO)](
    https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/).

    GEOS-CF offers a tool for atmospheric chemistry research, with the goal
    to supplement NASA's broad range of space-based and in-situ observations.
    GEOS-CF expands on the GEOS weather and aerosol modeling system by
    introducing the [GEOS-Chem](http://wiki.seas.harvard.edu/geos-chem/)
    chemistry module to provide hindcasts and 5-days forecasts of atmospheric
    constituents including ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide
    (NO<sub>2</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), coarse particulate matter 
    (PM<sub>10</sub>), and fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>). The
    chemistry module integrated in GEOS-CF is identical to the offline GEOS-Chem
    model and readily benefits from the innovations provided by the GEOS-Chem
    community.

    In October 2025, a major update to the GEOS-CF system was introduced as 
    GEOS-CF v2. This change included updates to the GEOS atmospheric general 
    circulation model and the GEOS-Chem chemical model, replaying meteorology to 
    [GEOS IT](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/gmao-products/geos-it/), direct assimilation 
    of stratospheric profiles and column ozone from NASA Aura OMI and MLS instruments, 
    and updates to the anthropogenic emission source. Evaluation of these updates is 
    ongoing; results will be added into this description as they become available.

    Users of GEOS-CF are encouraged to treat outputs from the original system (v1) 
    and the new system (v2) separately in their analysis, due to the extensive changes 
    between the systems.
