  title: 'NLCD 2021: USGS National Land Cover Database, 2021 release',
  version: '1.0',
  description: |||
    The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in partnership with several federal 
    agencies, has now developed and released seven National Land Cover 
    Database (NLCD) products: NLCD 1992, 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016, 2019, 
    and 2021. Beginning with the 2016 release, land cover products were 
    created for two-to-three-year intervals between 2001 and the most 
    recent year. These products provide spatially explicit and reliable 
    information on the Nationâ€™s land cover and land cover change. 
    NLCD continues to provide innovative, consistent, and robust 
    methodologies for production of a multi-temporal land cover and 
    land cover change database. The NLCD 2021 release is update based, 
    so the Land Cover and Impervious Surface products released in 2019 
    are unchanged and used directly with NLCD 2021 for change analysis 
    though the NLCD timespan. Science products and the change index are 
    updated and will need to be reacquired to contain the additional 2021 
    change. These new products use a streamlined compositing process for 
    assembling and preprocessing Landsat imagery and geospatial ancillary 
    datasets; a temporally, spectrally, and spatially integrated land cover 
    change analysis strategy; a theme-based post-classification protocol for 
    generating land cover and change products; a continuous fields 
    biophysical parameters modeling method; and a scripted operational system. 
    The overall accuracy of the 2019 Level I land cover was 91%. Results from 
    this study confirm the robustness of this comprehensive and highly automated 
    procedure for NLCD 2021 operational mapping 
    (see [doi:10.1080/15481603](https://doi.org/10.1080/15481603.2023.2181143) 
    for the latest accuracy assessment publication). Questions about the NLCD 
    2021 land cover product can be directed to the NLCD 2021 land cover 
    mapping team at USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or 
    mrlc@usgs.gov. See included spatial metadata for more details.

    for the 2019 release of NLCD which is used with the 2021 release for 
    comparisons through the years. Also refer to the larger NLCD Community
