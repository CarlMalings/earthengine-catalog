The Murray Global Tidal Wetland Change Dataset contains maps of the global
extent of tidal wetlands and their change. The maps were developed from a three
stage classification that sought to (i) estimate the global distribution of
tidal wetlands (defined as either tidal marsh, tidal flat or mangrove
ecosystems), (ii) detect their change over the study period, and (iii) estimate
the ecosystem type and timing of tidal wetland change events.

The dataset was produced by combining observations from 1,166,385 satellite
images acquired by Landsat 5 to 8 with environmental data of variables known
to influence the distributions of each ecosystem type, including temperature,
slope, and elevation. The image contains bands for a tidal wetland extent
product (random forest probability of tidal wetland occurrence) for the
start and end time-steps of the study period and a tidal wetland change product
over the full study period (loss and gain of tidal wetlands).

description of the methods, validation, and limitations of the data produced by
this software is available in the associated scientific paper.
